/*
 * Constraint Cclass to guarantee the condition that the ITS structure should be an alternating cycle.
 * An simple cyclic alternating ITS has a ring form in which each even ring pairs corresponds to
 * bond formulation (value = 1) i.e. edges in products the were not present in educts. While odd
 * ring pairs correspond to bond breaking (value = -1) i.e. edges in educts that are removed in
 * products.
